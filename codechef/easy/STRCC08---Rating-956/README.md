## Problem

### Practice problem - Chef and Happy String

Chef has a string $S$ with him consisting of only lowercase alphabets.
Chef is happy if the string contains a  **contiguous substring**  of length  **strictly greater**  than $2$ in which all its characters are vowels.
Determine whether Chef is happy or not.
 **Note** : in english alphabet, vowels are `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains of a single line of input, a string $S$.
### Output Format

For each test case, if Chef is happy, print `HAPPY` else print `SAD`.

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
aeiou
abxy
aebcdefghij
abcdeeafg

```

```
Happy
Sad
Sad
Happy

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Since the string `aeiou` is a contiguous substring and consists of all vowels and has a length $\gt 2$, Chef is happy.

 **Test case $2$:**  Since none of the contiguous substrings of the string consist of all vowels and have a length $\gt 2$, Chef is sad.

 **Test case $3$:**  Since none of the contiguous substrings of the string consist of all vowels and have a length $\gt 2$, Chef is sad.

 **Test case $4$:**  Since the string `eea` is a contiguous substring and consists of all vowels and has a length $\gt 2$, Chef is happy.

```c_cpp
//Update the code below
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    int t;
    scanf("%d", &t);

    while (t--) {
        char S[10001];
        scanf("%s", S);

        // your code here
       int count = 0;
        int happy = 0;

        for (int i = 0; S[i] != '\0'; i++) {

            if (S[i] == 'a' || S[i] == 'e' || S[i] == 'i' ||
                S[i] == 'o' || S[i] == 'u') {

                count++;

                if (count >= 3) {
                    happy = 1;
                    break;
                }

            } else {
                count = 0;
            }
        }

        if (happy)
            printf("HAPPY\n");
        else
            printf("SAD\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
