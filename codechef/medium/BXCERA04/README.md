## Problem

### Employee Records Persistence
- Imagine a system that needs to preserve employee records—including their name and salary—between program executions. To achieve this, the company decides to use serialization, a technique in Java that allows objects to be converted into a byte stream and saved to a file.
- In the provided code, an Employee class is defined with fields for name and salary. The goal is to serialize an Employee object to a file and then later deserialize it back into a usable object.

 **Task** 
You are required to complete the following two methods:

- saveEmployee() method in the SaveEmployee class: Serializes the provided Employee object. Writes it to a file with the given filename. On successful save, print: Serialized data is saved in <filename>
- loadEmployee() in the LoadEmployee class: Reads the serialized object from the given file. Deserializes it back into an Employee object. If successful, return the deserialized object.

 **Expected Output:** 

```
Serialized data is saved in employee.ser
Employee{name='John Doe', salary=60000.0}

```

```cpp
            employee = (Employee) in.readObject();
        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while loading the employee object from the file.");
        }
        return employee;
    }
}

class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an Employee object
        Employee employee = new Employee("John Doe", 60000.0);

        // Save the employee object to a file
        SaveEmployee.saveEmployee(employee, "employee.ser");

        // Load the employee object from the file
        Employee loadedEmployee = LoadEmployee.loadEmployee("employee.ser");
```
