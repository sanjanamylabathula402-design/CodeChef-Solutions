## Problem

### Discount

You are buying an item that costs $N$ rupees.

The shopkeeper gives you a special discount: you may remove  **exactly one digit**  from the decimal representation of $N$. The remaining digits, in the same order, form the new price you have to pay.

Your task is to find the  **minimum possible price**  after removing exactly one digit.

The resulting number may contain leading zeros. However, while printing the answer, leading zeros must not be printed.

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer $T$, the number of test cases.
- Each of the next $T$ lines contains a single integer $N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, print the minimum price that can be obtained after removing exactly one digit from $N$.

Print each answer on a separate line.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $10 \le N \le 10^9$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
57
908
1005
4321
```

```
5
8
5
321
```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:** 

For $N = 57$:

- Removing $5$ gives $7$.
- Removing $7$ gives $5$.

Therefore, the minimum possible price is $5$.

 **Test Case 2:** 

For $N = 908$:

- Removing $9$ gives $08$, which is printed as $8$.
- Removing $0$ gives $98$.
- Removing $8$ gives $90$.

Therefore, the minimum possible price is $8$.

 **Test Case 3:** 

For $N = 1005$, removing the first digit gives $005$, which is printed as $5$.

Therefore, the minimum possible price is $5$.

 **Test Case 4:** 

For $N = 4321$, the possible prices are $321$, $421$, $431$, and $432$.

Therefore, the minimum possible price is $321$.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int T = sc.nextInt();

        while (T-- > 0) {
            String n = sc.next();

            int remove = n.length() - 1;

            for (int i = 0; i < n.length() - 1; i++) {
                if (n.charAt(i) > n.charAt(i + 1)) {
                    remove = i;
                    break;
                }
            }

            String result = n.substring(0, remove) + n.substring(remove + 1);

            // Remove leading zeros
            result = result.replaceFirst("^0+", "");

            if (result.isEmpty()) {
                result = "0";
            }

            System.out.println(result);
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}
```
