## Problem

### Exam Result

Chef has received his exam results. He answered $C$ questions correctly and $W$ questions incorrectly. Each correct answer earns $M$ marks, while each incorrect answer deducts $P$ marks.

Chef needs a final score of  **at least $R$ marks**  to pass. Determine whether he passes the exam. His final score may be negative.

### Input Format

The only line contains five space-separated integers $C$, $M$, $W$, $P$, and $R$.

### Output Format

Print `YES` if Chef passes the exam, otherwise print `NO`.

### Constraints
- $0 \le C,W \le 100$
- $1 \le M,P \le 10$
- $0 \le R \le 1000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
8 4 2 1 30
```

```
YES
```

### Explanation:

Chef earns $8 \times 4=32$ marks and loses $2 \times 1=2$ marks. His final score is $30$, exactly the required score, so he passes.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
0 4 5 2 0
```

```
NO
```

### Explanation:

Chef earns no marks and loses $5 \times 2=10$ marks. His final score is $-10$, which is below the required score of $0$, so he fails.

int score = (c * m) - (w * p);

        if (score >= r) {

        } else {
            System.out.println("NO");
