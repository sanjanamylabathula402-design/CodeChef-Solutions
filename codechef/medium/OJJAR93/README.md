## Problem

### Dynamic Key Generation in React

We are building a  **Guest List App**  where users can see a list of invitees and remove them by clicking a  **Remove**  button.

However, the current code has a problem:  **it uses array indexes as keys**, which can cause React to behave unexpectedly when guests are removed.

#### Your Task:
- Identify the problem in the existing code.
- Update the code so that each guest has a unique key that does not change when items are added or removed.
- Improve the UI with some basic styling.

```cpp
                                <div className="container">
                                      <h1>Guest List</h1>
                                            <ul className="guest-list">
                                                    {guests.map((guest) => (
                                                              <li key={guest.id} className="guest-item">
                                                                          <input
                                                                                        defaultValue={guest.name}
                                                                                                      className="guest-input"
                                                                                                                  />
                                                                                                                              <button
                                                                                                                                            className="remove-btn"
                                                                                                                                                          onClick={() => removeGuest(guest.id)}
                                                                                                                                                                      >
                                                                                                                                                                                    Remove
                                                                                                                                                                                                </button>
                                                                                                                                                                                                          </li>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ))}
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </ul>
```
