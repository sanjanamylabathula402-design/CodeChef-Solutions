## Problem

### Task - Build a Simple To-Do List App

Follow these steps to complete the to-do list app. Don't worry - we'll take it step by step!

- Set Up the Tasks State In the App component, create a state variable called tasks using useState. Initialize it with an empty array.
- Create Add Task Function Complete the addTask function: it should take a new task as input and add it to the tasks array. Make sure empty tasks can't be added.
- Create Remove Task Function Complete the removeTask function: it should take an index (position number) and remove that task from the tasks array.
- Build the Input Component In TaskInput, add a state to track the input value using useState. Connect this state to the input field (when you type, it should update the state). When the "Add" button is clicked: Pass the current input value to addTask Clear the input field
- Display the Task List In TaskList, use the tasks array passed via props. Use.map() to display each task as a list item. For each task, add a "Remove" button that uses the task's index to call removeTask.
#### Tips:
- Remember to pass props between components (like tasks and removeTask)
- Use the array index to help remove the correct task
- Use filter() method when removing tasks
- You'll know it's working when you can add new tasks and remove them by clicking the buttons!

                                                                                                                                                                                        );
                                                                                                                                                                                          }
