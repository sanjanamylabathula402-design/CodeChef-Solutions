## Problem

### Task - HR Speed Optimization
- You are the lead developer for "TechCorp." The HR department complains that searching for employees by their Employee ID (empId) has become extremely slow as the company reached 5,000 employees.
- Your Goal: Identify the performance bottleneck using.explain() and fix it by creating a Single Field Index.

 **Step 1: Write the Index Command** 
You need to tell MongoDB to create a sorted list for that field. Use the `createIndex()` method on your collection.

- Inside the parentheses, you need an object: { fieldName: 1 }.
- The 1 tells MongoDB to sort the list in Ascending order.

 **Step 2: Run and Check** 
After you run your command, look at the output of the script.

- The Goal: You want the "Documents scanned after index" to be 1.
- If it is still 5,000, your index wasn't created correctly. If it is 1, your database is now optimized!

const slowSearch = db.staff.find({ empId: 4500 }).explain("executionStats");
print("Documents scanned before index: " + slowSearch.executionStats.totalDocsExamined);

db.staff.createIndex({ empId: 1 });

const fastSearch = db.staff.find({ empId: 4500 }).explain("executionStats");
print("Documents scanned after index: " + fastSearch.executionStats.totalDocsExamined);

```
