## Problem

### Chef and Pair of Elements

Chef has an array of integers $nums$.
He wants to invite two of his friends such that the  **sum of their lucky numbers equals a given target**  $X$.

Your task is to help Chef find the  **indices of the two numbers**  in the array whose sum is exactly $X$.

- Each input will have exactly one valid pair.
- You cannot use the same element twice.
- The index of the element that appears first in the array must be printed before the index of the element that appears later.
## Function Declaration
### Function Name

$findPair$ – Finds two indices of numbers in the array whose sum equals the target value.

### Parameters
- $nums$ : A list/array of integers.
- $target$ : An integer representing the required sum $X$.
### Return Value
- Returns the two indices of the numbers whose sum equals $target$. Answers are accepted on 0-based indexing.
## Constraints:
- $2 \leq nums.length \leq 10^4$
- $-10^9 \leq nums[i] \leq 10^9$
- $-10^9 \leq target \leq 10^9$ Only one valid answer exists.
### Input Format
- $N$ → size of array
- Next line → N integers (the array)
- Third line → target sum X
### Output Format

Print the two indices (0-based or 1-based depending on implementation; your samples use  **0-based**).

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
3 5 2 6
7

```

```
1 2

```

### Explanation:

1 index = 5
2 index = 2
5+2=7

```c_cpp
public static int[] findPair(int[] nums, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int required = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(required)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(required), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{-1, -1};

}
```
