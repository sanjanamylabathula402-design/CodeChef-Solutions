## Problem

### Delayed Order Confirmation

Let's simulate an online order confirmation process. We'll use both synchronous and asynchronous operations to illustrate the difference.

 **The Task:** 

A user places an order. We want to print three messages: "Order placed!", "Confirming order...", and "Order confirmed!".
However, we want to delay the "Confirming order..." message by 2 seconds using `setTimeout`.
This will demonstrate how asynchronous operations allow the program to continue executing while waiting for the order confirmation.

## Solution

**Language:** C++  
**Runtime:** N/A  
**Memory:** N/A  
**Submitted:** 2026-10-21T16:17:06.905Z  

```cpp
console.log("Order placed!");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Confirming order...");
    }, 2000);

    console.log("Order confirmed!");
```
